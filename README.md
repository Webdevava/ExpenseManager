# ExpenseManager

ExpenseManager is a web application built using React that allows users to track their expenses by adding their expense name, amount spent, and date. The application also provides filtering options to view expenses based on the selected year.

## Features

- Add new expenses by entering the expense details such as name, amount spent, and date. The entered expenses are added to the expense list and displayed on the screen.
- View expenses in a table format with columns for expense name, amount, date, and an action button to delete the expense.
- Filter expenses by year. Users can select a year from the dropdown list, and the expenses will be filtered based on the selected year.
- Responsive design that adjusts based on the screen size, making it easy to use on devices of different sizes.
